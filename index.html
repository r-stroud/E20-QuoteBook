        <p>"I never dreamed about success. I worked for it." —Estée Lauder</p>
        <p>"Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to
            become the best of which you are capable." —John Wooden</p>
        <p>"Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than
            unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not;
            the world is full of educated derelicts. The slogan 'Press On' has solved and always will solve the problems
            of the human race." —Calvin Coolidge</p>
        <p>"Success usually comes to those who are too busy looking for it." — Henry David Thoreau</p>
